               <p>The Vigenère cipher first appeared in the 1585 book Traicté des Chiffres (A Treatise on Secret Writing) by Blaise de Vigenère.</p>

         <p>However, Giovan Batista Belaso discussed a similar technique in his 1553 booklet La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Batista Belaso [KAHN1967, page 137]. Singh [SINGH1999, pp. 45--51, Chapter 2] has a short and interesting discussion about Vigenère, which is quoted below, and Kahn [KAHN1967, page 137, Chapter 4] has a longer and more detailed exposition. On the other hand, the book of Vigenère did present an auto-key system, which is perhaps his major contribution to cryptography in addition to the Vigenère cipher. We will not discuss this auto-key systems.</p>

            <p>Vigenère became acquainted with the writings of Alberti, Trithemius and Porta when, at the age of twenty-six, he was sent to Rome on a two year diplomatic mission. To start with, his interest in cryptography was purely practical and was linked to his diplomatic work. Then, at the age of thirty-nine, Vigenère decided that he had accumulated enough money for him to be able to abandon his career and concentrate on a life of study. It was only then that he examined in detail the ideas of Alberti, Trithemius, and Porta, weaving them into a coherent and powerful new cipher [SINGH1999, page 46. </p>
